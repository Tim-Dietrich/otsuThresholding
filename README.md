# otsuThresholding
This is a working implementation of the the otsu algorithm. It was originally part of a larger project but I decided to cut it out and put it on here.
With this application images are binarized, meaning only 0 and 1 (black and white) remain. In order to achieve this I use OpenCV.

A simple sample image with a difficult case has already been added and will be binarized with the custom otsu algorithm.
